* **Patients:** Difficulty booking appointments, long waiting times, lack of visibility into doctor schedules.
* **Doctors:** Overlapping schedules, no real-time updates on cancellations or rescheduling.
* **Admins:** Manual management of appointments, report generation, and notifications.
* **System:** Need for scalability, real-time updates, and integration with mobile apps.

## Solution Overview

The system offers:

* **Patient Features:** Registration, book/cancel/reschedule appointments, view doctor profiles, receive real-time notifications.
* **Doctor Features:** Manage availability, view appointments, receive notifications for bookings or cancellations.
* **Admin Features:** Manage users (patients, doctors, admins), generate reports (PDF, CSV, XLSX), monitor system activity.
* **System Features:**

  * RESTful API for mobile apps or third-party integrations.
  * WebSocket for real-time notifications.
  * Event-driven architecture for handling actions.
  * Microservices for notifications and reporting.
  * Multi-role permissions (patients, doctors, admins).
  * Queues (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for asynchronous tasks.
  * Scheduling for automated tasks (reminders).
  * File exports for reports in PDF, CSV, XLSX.

## Database Design

### Entities and Relationships

**Users:**

* `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
* Roles: Patient, Doctor, Admin (via Spatie Permission)

**Roles & Permissions:**

* Tables: roles, permissions, role\_has\_permissions, model\_has\_roles, model\_has\_permissions
* Example Permissions: `book-appointment`, `view-appointments`, `manage-users`

**Doctors:**

* `id`, `user_id`, `specialization`, `bio`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
* Relationship: Belongs to User (Doctor role)

**Appointments:**

* `id`, `patient_id`, `doctor_id`, `date`, `time`, `status` (pending, confirmed, cancelled), `created_at`, `updated_at`
* Relationships:

  * Belongs to Patient (User)
  * Belongs to Doctor (User)

**Schedules:**

* `id`, `doctor_id`, `date`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `is_available`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
* Relationship: Belongs to Doctor

**Notifications:**

* `id`, `user_id`, `type` (email, sms, websocket), `message`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
* Relationship: Belongs to User

**Reports:**

* `id`, `user_id` (admin), `type` (pdf, csv, xlsx), `file_path`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
* Relationship: Belongs to Admin

If you want, I can also **generate a visually enhanced version** with **diagrams using Mermaid.js** so it looks more professional on GitHub.

Do you want me to do that?
